# BEM (Block Element Modifier)

BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS to create reusable and maintainable code. It's particularly useful for large-scale projects where CSS can easily become complex and difficult to manage.

```css
/* Block */
.button {}

/* Element */
.button__icon {}

/* Modifier for button size */
.button--large {}

/* Modifier for button color */
.button--primary {}
