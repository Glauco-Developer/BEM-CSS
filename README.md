BEM (Block Element Modifier) is a popular naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS to create reusable and maintainable code. It's particularly useful for large-scale projects where CSS can easily become complex and difficult to manage.

/* Block */
.button {}

/* Element */
.button__icon {}

/* Modifier for button size */
.button--large {}

/* Modifier for button color */
.button--primary {}

Block (.button): This is the main component or container. It represents the highest level of abstraction of the component.

Element (.button__icon): This represents a part of the block that performs a certain function within the context of the block. In this case, it's an icon within the button.

Modifiers (.button--large, .button--primary): These are classes that alter the appearance or behavior of the block. Modifiers can be applied to both blocks and elements. In the example, .button--large modifies the button to be larger, and .button--primary modifies the button to have a primary color scheme.

By using BEM, you create a clear and predictable structure for your CSS classes, making it easier to understand and maintain your code. It also promotes reusability since you can easily apply the same classes to other similar components throughout your project. Additionally, BEM helps prevent CSS specificity issues and conflicts by keeping styles scoped to specific components.
